# Hack.Moscow

## What are we making?
We are making a service for [trancparency international](https://transparency.org.ru)
By using data from [declator](https://declarator.org/) 
Our service constructs visualization of tax returns of russian officials (we use data from russia, but it can be adjusted for any region of the world).
Visualization data is chosen by the user from list of goverment structure groups

Also our project uses Benford's law to find anomalies in data. 
That will help find corrupt officials
